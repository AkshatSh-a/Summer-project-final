        <h1>Science and AI in Consumer Safety</h1>
        <p>Science and AI are essential for consumer safety. Scientific methods like chemical, microbiological, and physical testing, along with toxicological studies, help ensure products are safe. AI innovations, such as the Automated Hazard Detection System, enhance safety by collecting data, analyzing risks using machine learning, providing real-time analysis, and predicting future hazards. This system aids regulatory compliance and ensures higher safety standards for products before they reach consumers.</p>
